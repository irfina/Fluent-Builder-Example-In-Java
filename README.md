# Fluent Builder Example in Java

"Fluent (or Staged) Builder is a pattern used to assemble object instances. Unlike the traditional Builder pattern, it prevents the creation of incomplete objects and enforces a fixed order of field initialization. These properties make it the preferred choice for reliable and maintainable code." - Sergiy Yevtushenko
